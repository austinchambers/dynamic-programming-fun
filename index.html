    <p>We all want to have fun! This is a very easy concept. </p>


    <p>Having fun often involves the amount of fun that you get from an activity: </p>
      <br><br>

    <div class="row image-row">
        <div class="col-12">
            <img class="intro-heart intro-img" src="figures/altheart1_small_nonum.png">
            <img class="intro-heart intro-img" src="figures/altheart3_small_nonum.png">
            <img class="intro-heart intro-img" src="figures/altheart5_small_nonum.png">
            <img class="intro-heart intro-img" src="figures/altheart7_small_nonum.png">
            <img class="intro-heart intro-img" src="figures/altheart9_small_nonum.png">
        </div>
    </div>

    <br><br>

    <p>And the time you have: </p>

    <div class="row image-row">
        <div class="col-12">
            <img id="time-img" src="figures/open_icons/time.png">
        </div>
    </div>

    <br><br>

    <p>Activities have a fun value <span><img class="intro-heart intro-img" src="figures/heart7_small.png"></span> and they also take up time: </p>

      <div class="row image-row">
        <div class="col-12">
            <img id="time-open-img" src="figures/open_icons/time-open.png">
        </div>
    </div>

    <br><br>

    <p>Scheduling fun can look like this: </p>


    <div class="row image-row">
        <div class="col-12">
            <img id="beach-gym-img" src="figures/open_icons/beach_and_gym_no_heart.png"> =
            <img class="intro-heart intro-img" src="figures/altheart8_small.png">
        </div>
    </div>

    <br><br>


    <p>But your time is limited! You often need to make decisions as to what activities you can fit in your schedule so you can have the most fun. </p>
    <p> Play around and try to maximize the amount of fun you can have with a given amount of time: </p>

    <!-- One Hour -->
    <iframe src="interactions/scheduling/schedule.html" style="height:600px" scrolling="no" embedded></iframe>

    <p>
        To solve this, schedule the date with the hike to get the maximum value of 9.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Now imagine if you were given 100 activities and many more hours to schedule.  This is a much bigger and harder problem to solve with all the activities at once.
    </p>
     <p>
        But instead of trying to consider all the activities at once, we can divide the larger problem into much smaller subproblems.  Let's start with the smallest subproblem which is just one activity in 1 hour.  Try it here:
    </p>

    <!-- One Hour -->
    <iframe id="01-1" src="interactions/grid/01-1-hour.html" scrolling="no" embedded></iframe>

    <p>
        Super Simple. Even though this seems incredibly easy to do, its important to start from the smallest subproblem. We can work our way up, by increasing either time or adding another activity. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's increase time first, so try maximizing our total value with the same activity, but with 2 hours of time:
    </p>

    <!-- Two Hour -->
    <iframe id="01-2" src="interactions/grid/01-2-hour.html" scrolling="no" embedded></iframe>

    <!--Three to Six Hour-->
    <p id="01-3">
        We need to solve each subproblem for every hour before adding another activity.  You should notice that no matter what amount of time you have (3 hours, 4 hours, and so on), you will only get a max value of the one activity you are considering (in this case 1).   </p>
        <p> Try this for 7 hours, the longest block of time we are scheduling:
    </p>

    <!-- Seven Hour -->
    <iframe id="01-7" src="interactions/grid/01-7-hour.html" scrolling="no" embedded></iframe>

        <!--<table id="grid-01">-->
            <!--<tr>-->
                <!--<th></th>-->
                <!--<th><img class="time-icon" src="figures/time_icons/1h.png"></th>-->
                <!--<th><img class="time-icon" src="figures/time_icons/2h.png"></th>-->
                <!--<th><img class="time-icon" src="figures/time_icons/3h.png"></th>-->
                <!--<th><img class="time-icon" src="figures/time_icons/4h.png"></th>-->
                <!--<th><img class="time-icon" src="figures/time_icons/5h.png"></th>-->
                <!--<th><img class="time-icon" src="figures/time_icons/6h.png"></th>-->
                <!--<th><img class="time-icon" src="figures/time_icons/7h.png"></th>-->
            <!--</tr>-->
        <!--</table>-->

    <p>
        You just solved all the possibilities for one activity, breaking everything down into a series of subproblems. 
        This is the first step in Dynamic Programming.  
    </p>

    <p>
        No matter how many hours you have, considering only the gym, you get a max value of 1. We will save these values in a table so that we can reuse them later.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that we have considered one activity, let's add our second activity: going on a date.  We will start again with one hour.  Considering both the gym and a date, what can you do in one hour?
    </p>

    <!-- Add date, 1 Hour -->
    <iframe src="interactions/add_date/1-hour.html" style="height:600px" scrolling="no" embedded></iframe>

    <p>Dragging the "date" into the timeline will not fit. Instead, you can only select the gym. 
    You previously already solved this problem, so you can just click on that value in your table to reuse your previous solution.</p>

    <p> Let's try this again for two hours: </p>

    <!-- Add date, 2 Hour -->
    <iframe src="interactions/add_date/2-hour.html" style="height:600px" scrolling="no" embedded></iframe>

    <p>Again, a date does not fit. Notice that you can reuse your previous solution <em> from the two hours column </em> in the first row of your table.</p>

    <p> What happens now in three hours? </p>

    <!-- Add date, 3 Hour -->
    <iframe src="interactions/add_date/3-hour.html" style="height:600px" scrolling="no" embedded></iframe>

    <p>You can now schedule a date and get a max value of 4.  </p>

    <p> Let's try this again, but with 4 hours: </p>

    <!-- Add date, 4 Hour -->
    <iframe src="interactions/add_date/4-hour.html" style="height:600px" scrolling="no" embedded></iframe>

    <p>After scheduling the date, there is one hour left. To get the maximum value for the time remaining, you reuse your previous solution from the corresponding time left in the row above. </p>

    <p> To visualize this better, play around with the following table that we continuned for you.  Notice how the optimal values for the remaining time are taken from the previous row. 

    <!-- Fill in table up to beach -->
    <iframe src="interactions/add_beach/3-table.html" style="height:600px;" scrolling="no" embedded></iframe>

    <!-- Show table with 3 rows so far, explore! -->

    <p> In the table above, hover over the bottom-right square on the value of 9. This value is created by first considering the hike (value 5), which takes 4 hours. You have 7 hours total, so the max value for the remaining time of 3 hours is calculated by reusing your solution from the row above (value 4). These two values (5 and 4) are added to get your current max value of 9. </p>

    <p>Finally, let's consider the beach, our last activity.  Suppose we have seven hours free. Should we go to the beach?</p>

    <!-- Add beach, 7 Hour -->
    <iframe src="interactions/add_beach/7-hour.html" style="height:700px" scrolling="no" embedded></iframe>

    <p>When we have 7 hours and all of our activities, going to the beach and the gym does not maximize our fun. Taking the beach out of our schedule allows us to scheudule the date and the hike, for a max value of 9 instead of 8. In this case, taking our previously solved solution for the entire 7 hours from the row above is our optimal solution.</p>

    <p> Sadly, to maximize our fun, we don't go to the beach! <p/>

    <p> Check out our table with all four activities: <p/>

    <iframe src="interactions/add_beach/full-table.html" style="height:660px;" scrolling="no" embedded></iframe>

    <p> Notice above how our optimal solution in the bottom right square of our table uses the previously solved value from the row above it. </p>

    <p>Even though it seems that we've filled out our table, there is one more thing to complete the dynamic programming lesson...  Try this:</p>

    <!-- 0 Hour -->
    <iframe src="interactions/grid/01-0-hour.html" scrolling="no" embedded></iframe>

    <p> Completely obvious. With 0 time, you get 0 value. </p>

    <p> This is actually a base case, something that can be solved without relying on a previously solved subproblem.  We can now complete our table by adding a column of zeros on the left. Check it out below:</p>

    <!-- Show full table, four rows -->
    <iframe src="interactions/add_beach/zero-table.html" style="height:660px" scrolling="no" embedded></iframe>

      <p> As you hover over the table, notice that all the base cases are in the top row and left column. You do not need any other solutions to solve these.  However, all the other squares require other values other than themselves for their solutions, but only from their own row or the previous row of saved values. </p>

      <p>We could continue adding time and activities, and using a Dynamic Programming approach, we would reach our optimal solution every time, even if we had hundreds of activities and many more hours.</p>

      <p>These core concepts in Dynamic Programming are used in countless applications in computer science, mathematics, management science and bioinformatics.  They simply involve a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each once, then saving and reusing each solution to solve a larger problem. </p>

        <p>But more importantly, we want you to see how Dynamic Programming can be useful and easy to do, especially when it comes to maximizing your fun! </p>
