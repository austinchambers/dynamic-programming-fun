    <p>Dynamic Programming is a concept in computer science, mathematics,
        management science and bioinformatics, involving a method for solving a
        complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler
        subproblems, solving each once, then saving and reusing each solution
        to solve a larger problem.</p>

    <div class="instruction">
        How does this work?
    </div>

    <p>
        Let's walk through an example of this using something we all do on a daily basis: scheduling our free time.
        Imagine that there are four daily activities that you would like to do once, but each one takes a
        specific amount of <span class="time">time:</span>
    <p>

        <img src="figures/intro-hours-visual.png" alt="Hours Visual" display: block; margin: auto; width: 40%;>

    <p>
        Naturally, you get different amounts of pleasure from different things.
        Now, imagine if you gave each activity an "<span class="enjoyment">enjoyment value</span>" where
        the number of points indicate a value of how much happiness and
        enjoyment you get from something (higher number = more enjoyment). Let's
        call this each item's "<span class="enjoyment">e.v.</span>" and make up some values for each activity:
    </p>

    <img src="figures/intro-enjoyment-visual.png" alt="Enjoyment Visual" display: block; margin: auto; width: 40%;>

    <p>
        If you were given a block of seven hours of time, how would you
        schedule your activities to maximize your enjoyment score?
    </p>

    <p>
        While you certainly can use trial and error to figure this out, there is
        actually a systematic way using dynamic programming techniques to
        solve this problem.

    <div class="instruction-title">
        It's a bit confusing, right?
    </div>

    <p>
        (If you played around with the above interaction long enough, you
        might have figured out that the max score would have been created
        by scheduling a date and a hike together.)
    </p>

    <div class="instruction-title">
        But what if you had 10 different
        events and 12 hours? Or 100?
    </div>
    <p>
        It would take a much longer time to figure everything out using the above
        method.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is where the concept of Dynamic Programming canm be used to help create a
        systemic method to solving this larger problem.
