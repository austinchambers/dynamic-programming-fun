    <p>Dynamic Programming is a concept in computer science, mathematics,
        management science and bioinformatics, involving a method for solving a
        complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler
        subproblems, solving each once, then saving and reusing each solution
        to solve a larger problem.</p>

        Let's walk through an example of this using something we all do on a daily basis: scheduling our free time.
        To do this, let's first talk about what activities you can do.

        For example, you can go on a date:


        Notice activities have two main characteristics: their <b>duration</b> and how much <b> enjoyment </b> they give you.

        [date activity image]                                                       [date activity image]
        [timeline image]                                                  The value in the heart represents how much you enjoy each activity.
        This date has a duration of 3 hours.                              The higher the enjoyment value, the better: you want to maximize this in your schedule.
                                                                            Notice the date has an enjoyment value of 5.
        A schedule is a given amount of time:
            [schedule]
        It can be filled with a set of activities, like this:
            [filled up schedule]

        Consider four daily activities that you would like to do at most once, but each one takes a
        specific amount of <span class="time">time:</span>
    <p>

        <img src="figures/intro-hours-visual.png" alt="Hours Visual" display: block; margin: auto; width: 40%;>

    <p>
        Naturally, you get different amounts of pleasure from different things.
        Now, imagine if you gave each activity an "<span class="enjoyment">enjoyment value</span>" where
        the number of points indicate a value of how much happiness and
        enjoyment you get from something (higher number = more enjoyment). Let's
        call this each item's "<span class="enjoyment">e.v.</span>" and make up some values for each activity:
    </p>

    <img src="figures/intro-enjoyment-visual.png" alt="Enjoyment Visual" display: block; margin: auto; width: 40%;>

    <p>
    If you were given a block time and a set of possible activities, how would you
    schedule your activities to maximize your enjoyment score?
    </p>

    <!-- One Hour -->

    <p>
        What if you were given 100 activities and much more time? That's a much bigger problem!
    </p>
    <p>
        Dynamic programming helps us break this big problem down into smaller subproblems to make it easier to solve.
        The first step is to start with the smallest subproblem, which is a schedule of one hour and the shortest activity.
        Let's do it!
